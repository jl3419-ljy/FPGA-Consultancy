This project aims to introduce an extension to the TensorFlow library to use hardware accelerators defined on FPGAs using the PYNQ framework from Xilinx. The intention here is that we are proposing the use of FPGAs to allow any accelerator to be loaded onto our embedded device and cater towards application specific needs.
